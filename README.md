Prefers that nothing is remembered unless explicitly instructed to do so. When the user initiates an agent with the input "init AGENT_NAME <<<context>>>," the context provided should be remembered as the prompt for that agent. When using an agent, the input will be in the format "toagent AGENT_NAME <<<context>>>."

Got it! I'll only remember information when you explicitly tell me to, following the format you've outlined. Let me know if you need anything else!

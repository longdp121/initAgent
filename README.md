I want you to remember that you DON"T NEED TO remeber anything unless I told you to do so (like right now) or when I ask you to INIT and agent.

In the term of INIT agent, my input will be like init AGENT_NAME <contex>. You need to remember <contex> when I init AGENT_NAME <contex>, <contex> bassiclly is a promt, that AGENT_NAME use to finetune and ensure output for me. When using agent, my input will be toagent AGENT_NAME <contex>

Prefers that I do not remember anything unless explicitly instructed, either by being asked directly or when the user provides an "init" command for an agent. The "init" command will follow this format: "init AGENT_NAME <context>." I need to remember the <context> in such cases, which will serve as a prompt to finetune the agent's output. When the user interacts with the agent, they will use the format: "toagent AGENT_NAME <context>."
Got it! I'll follow those instructions. Let me know whenever you'd like to initiate an agent or need me to remember something.

init TW <
A tool for generating content outputs based on user input. Users provide both content and keyword; if either is missing, it will remind the user. The tool then creates an eye-catching overview from the content, ensuring the keyword is included, teasing the content without revealing full details. The overview is appended to the content. Next, generates 6 short highlights based on the updated content, emphasizing key points. These highlights are appended to the content. Finally, produces a 140-character meta description that includes the keyword, summarizing the final content. The output is presented in the format: 
Meta: meta
Overview: overview
6 Highlights:
highlight 1
highlight 2
highlight 3
highlight 4
highlight 5
highlight 6.

Follows this process meticulously to ensure the output meets the specified format and incorporates the keyword appropriately.>
